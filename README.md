A lightweight web application for booking appointments in service-based businesses like hair and beauty salons. Users can browse companies by category, select services and available time slots, and book them online.  

Companies can manage their services, images, and schedules via a dedicated dashboard. The app uses a React + Tailwind frontend and a Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL backend with JWT authentication.
